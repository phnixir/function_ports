- Source code was modified and made sure to run under both linux and windows
- getopt.h was all written by me when i scraped both the glibc source and stackoverflow
- Main getopt_long() function was from https://opensource.apple.com/source/Kerberos/Kerberos-47/KerberosFramework/Kerberos5/Sources/util/windows/getopt_long.c.auto.html
- That source was formatted very oddly and also had many conflicting lines and errors which i solved
- Compiled with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic to make sure I don't miss any warnings
- Notes :
    - Was compiled using mingw32-make and the mingw32 compiler for windows using the same makefile
    - Same makefile and with GNU/Make and GCC for linux
